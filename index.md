## About me

**I am an Assistant Professor in the [CS department at the University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), also affiliated with the Maryland Cybersecurity Center and UMIACS.**

My research interests are in programming languages, formal methods, and systems for non-traditional computing platforms, broadly speaking. 
I want to provide the formal models, enforcement mechanisms, and language abstractions necessary for designing emerging computing platforms to meet well-defined correctness and security guarantees from the ground up, allowing programmers to unlock the full potential of their system without compromising trustworthiness. Check out the PLUM lab to learn more about PL research at UMD: [PLUM](https://plum-umd.github.io/).

**I am always interested in working with motivated Masters and Ph.D. students who share a demonstrable interest in PL/Architecture/Security challenges. I'm generally happy to work with UMD undergrads as well, if they have taken one of my courses or attended one of my talks.**

Previously, I was a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Brandon Lucia and Limin Jia. My research focused on designing formally correct 
intermittent systems for energy-harvesting devices. I leveraged formal correctness reasoning to provide practical tools and systems that guarantee intermittent computing applications for these devices would run correctly.  

I am honored to have received the [CyLab Presidential Fellowship](https://cylab.cmu.edu/news/2021/08/11-presidential-fellows.html) in 2021. More recently, I won first place in the PLDI 22 SRC for 
my work on creating a type system for reasoning about correct intermittent execution, and 
I was selected as a [2022 Rising Star in EECS](https://risingstars.utexas.edu/profiles/milijana-surbatovich)
