## About me

I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Brandon Lucia and Limin Jia. My research interests are in programming languages, formal methods, and systems for intermittently powered energy harvesting devices, and non-traditional computing systems more broadly. 
I want to provide the formal models, enforcement mechanisms, and language abstractions necessary for designing emerging computing platforms to meet well-defined correctness guarantees from the ground up, allowing programmers to unlock the full potential of their system without compromising trustworthiness.

My PhD research focused on
operationalizing formal correctness reasoning to provide practical tools and systems that guarantee intermittent computing applications will run correctly. If you want to know more about intermittent computing, check out our lab website: [Abstract Research Group](http://abstract.ece.cmu.edu/). 

I am honored to have received the [CyLab Presidential Fellowship](https://cylab.cmu.edu/news/2021/08/11-presidential-fellows.html) in 2021. More recently, I won first place in the PLDI 22 SRC for 
my work on creating a type system for reasoning about correct intermittent execution, and 
I was selected as a [2022 Rising Star in EECS](https://risingstars.utexas.edu/profiles/milijana-surbatovich)

**I am on the tenure-track faculty job market for 2023**, primarily 
looking at schools in the US and Canada. Please reach out if you 
think my research would be a good fit for your department.
